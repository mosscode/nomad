COMPONENTS

    api - the contract between a migration-def and nomad

    core
		def - defines the xml format to store information about updates.

		history - defines an xml format describing what updates have been 
            applied to a given data set.

		packager - constructs an update jar.

		runner - executes updates from an update jar.

    maven-plugin - the thing that lets you configure the packager to run as part
        of the maven build.

	prep-maven-plugin - an optional plugin that records a project's 
        dependencies in META-INF/classpath.xml as part of the build.

    test-migration-handler - used for automated testing.

	test-migration-support - used for automated testing.

    test-migration-case - used for more real-world automated testing.

CONCERNS

	The migration-defs.xml file references a specific version of each artifact.
    It would probably make sense for the version of that artifact to be bumped
    to the release version once it has been released. It might be possible to
    somehow incorporate this into the release process? It might just be more
    trouble than its worth.

    We've talked about implementing some sort of workspace-awareness logic into
    the runner such that it uses workspace/project/target/classes for its 
    classpath where it make sense. This also might be more trouble than its 
    worth.
